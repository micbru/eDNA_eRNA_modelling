This folder contains all of the code and results from fitting the data with the eDNA/eRNA decay model.

The .csv files starting with eDNA_Data are the actual data measurements.

These are fit in R using the .Rmd file, Grayling_FinalFits.Rmd, which additionally outputs the fit values to .csv files (those starting with lower case).

These fit values are then read into python for fitting in the .ipynb notebooks, which finally outputs .pdf figures.
